# Merge - Developer Social Platform - Project Overview

## Project Idea

Merge is a comprehensive social platform designed specifically for developers to connect, collaborate, and showcase their work. The platform aims to bridge the gap between professional networking and technical content sharing by providing a space where developers can:

- Showcase their projects with detailed information and GitHub integration
- Share technical knowledge through blog posts and articles
- Stay updated with the latest technology news and trends
- Connect with other developers for collaboration and networking
- Engage in meaningful discussions about technology and development practices

The core vision is to create a developer-centric social network that values technical expertise and knowledge sharing over traditional social media metrics.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router for server-side rendering and optimized performance
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and improved development experience
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui for accessible and customizable components
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state management
- **API Communication**: Custom React hooks for data fetching and API interactions

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js for the backend server
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints following standard conventions
- **ORM**: Prisma ORM for database operations and type safety
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with Neon as the recommended provider) for relational data storage
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with GitHub OAuth for secure user authentication
- **API Integrations**: Services for GitHub, Hacker News, and Dev.to APIs

### Data Flow
1. Frontend requests data through API routes or direct backend calls
2. Backend processes requests, validates data, and communicates with the database
3. External APIs are integrated through dedicated service layers
4. Responses are formatted and sent back to the frontend
5. Caching strategies may be implemented for improved performance

## Tech Stack

### Frontend Technologies
- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router, server components, and optimized bundling

## Database Schema

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main entities:

- **Users**: Store user information, authentication data, and profile details
- **Projects**: Repository information synced from GitHub with additional metadata
- **Posts/Blogs**: User-generated content including technical articles
- **Messages**: Direct messaging between users
- **Notifications**: System and social notifications
